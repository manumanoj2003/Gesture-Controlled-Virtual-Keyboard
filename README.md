Hand Identification and Virtual Keyboard Typing
A computer vision-based project that enables users to interact with a virtual keyboard using hand gestures. The system utilizes a webcam to track and identify hand movements and converts them into virtual keystrokes. This is a contactless typing solution powered by MediaPipe and OpenCV, making it both interactive and accessible.

Features
Real-Time Hand Tracking: Tracks and identifies hands using the MediaPipe framework.
Virtual Keyboard: Displays an on-screen keyboard that users can interact with by moving their hands.
Gesture Detection: Detects hand gestures (e.g., index and middle finger positioning) to press virtual keys.
Terminate Option: Includes a "Terminate" button for closing the program.
Dynamic Typing: Enables the typing of letters, symbols, and text using hand gestures in mid-air.

Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to implement the project.
MediaPipe: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
OpenCV: For capturing video from the webcam and rendering the virtual keyboard.

System Requirements
Python 3.7 or later
A webcam (built-in or external)

Libraries:
OpenCV
MediaPipe
Math
Time

Usage
Launch the program: Run the virtual_keyboard.py file to start the application.
Virtual Keyboard: A virtual keyboard will appear on the screen.
Hand Tracking:
Use your index and middle fingers to hover over the desired key.
Move your hand close to a key to "press" it.

Project Workflow
Hand Tracking:
The MediaPipe Hands solution is used to detect the position of hand landmarks in real time.
The system identifies gestures based on finger movements.

Virtual Keyboard Interaction:
The on-screen keyboard is displayed using OpenCV.
When fingers hover over a key, the system highlights the key.
Moving fingers close to a key triggers a "press" action.

Text Display:
The typed text is displayed on the screen in real time.
